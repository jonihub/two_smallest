# Two Smallest

## Design by Induction

#### Submission for CPSC 280

This is a program which finds the two smallest elements in an array from user input.

Must implement **induction** (use a loop).

```java
set small1 and small2
for loop to handle the n numbers that you read 
update small1 and small2 each time through the loop
```
